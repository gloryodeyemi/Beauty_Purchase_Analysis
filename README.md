# 🛠️  End-to-End Data Pipeline for Beauty Products Purchase Analysis
An end-to-end data engineering and analysis project that builds an automated data pipeline from Google Sheets to Snowflake, orchestrated with Apache Airflow and visualized in Tableau. This project captures real-world personal beauty product purchases, transforming raw entries into structured insights.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes real-world beauty product purchase data through a robust data pipeline and visualization framework. It was designed to:
* Track personal purchase behaviors and product preferences.
* Uncover trends in spending, product types, and brand loyalty.
* Serve as a template for others to understand purchase patterns using real-life data and modern analytics tools.

## 🔄 ELT Pipeline Architecture
### 1. Extract
  * Source: Google Sheets with manually logged purchase data.
  * Tool: Python uses gspread and pandas to pull the data.

### 2. Transform
  * Initial transformations: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, data type conversion, data validation, and standardization, joining, and creating new columns.
  * Tool: Python pandas library.

### 3. Load
  * The transformed data is loaded into a raw schema/table in Snowflake
  * Tool: Snowflake Python Connector.

### 4. Further Transformations
  * Data modeling: The fact and dimension tables are designed in Snowflake using the Snowflake schema.
  * Records are inserted into the appropriate fact and dimension tables using a stored procedure.
  * Tool: Snowflake SQL.

### 5. Orchestration
  * Apache Airflow DAG runs the full pipeline weekly.
  * Handles error logging and ensures consistent data refresh.

### 6. Visualization
  * Tableau is connected to Snowflake (initially live, now extracted).
  * The final dashboard is built to explore trends, KPIs, and insights.
  * Tool: Tableau Cloud for dashboard building and Tableau Public for publishing.

## 📑 Data Source Summary
  * Origin: Manually logged Google Sheet tracking beauty product purchases.
  * Tracked Fields: Date_Bought, Product_Name (as written by the store), Short_Name (actual product name), Product_Category, Product_Type, Product_Purpose, Brand, Store, Quantity, Unit_Price, and Total_Price.
  * Modified fields: Date_Bought, Product_Name (Brand + '-' + Short_Name), Product_Category, Product_Type, Product_Purpose, Brand, Store, Quantity, Unit_Price, Total_Price, and Price_Category (low, medium, and high - created from unit price).
  * ETL Flow: Google Sheets → Python (extraction, clean/transform) → Snowflake (raw, fact/dim tables) → Tableau (dashboard).
  * Current State: Due to platform limitations, Tableau Public is used for final publishing with an extracted version of the Snowflake data.

## 📊 Final Output: Dashboard
A Tableau interactive dashboard was created to explore and communicate the insights derived from the data. It includes:
  * Overview Dashboard: Annual trends, spending summaries, top products, stores & brands, and top 10 recent purchases.
  * Product Dashboard: Product analysis and detailed table of all purchased items with filters/sort.
  * Brand Dashboard: Brand analysis detailed table of all brands with filters/sort.
  * Dashboard Documentation: Reference material on navigating and using the dashboard.

## 👩🏽‍💻 Future Work
1. **Deploy the Pipeline to the Cloud:** Host the existing Airflow pipeline on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS EC2) and connect it to a managed Snowflake instance for seamless scheduling and scalability.
2. **Add Predictive Analytics:** Train and integrate a simple regression or time-series model within Snowflake (using Snowpark) to forecast future product demand.
3. **Implement Notifications:** Set up email notifications for pipeline failures and completions.
